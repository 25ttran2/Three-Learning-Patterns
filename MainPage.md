# Classical Conditioning
- Process of anticipating events
- Discoved by Ivan Pavlov
  - Studying the digestive system of dogs, specificly their drool
  1. Dogs were given food *\(**unconditioned stimulus**\)* and drooled *\(**unconditioned response**\)*
  2. Bell was rung *(**neutral stimulus**)* before the arrive of food
  3. Dogs started to drool *\(**conditioned response**\)* at the bell *\(now **conditioned stimulus**\)* before the food came out
- An unconditioned stimulus will always result in an unconditioned response
- A neutral stimulus never gives a response
- The learner associates the neutral stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus
- The neutral stimulus becomes the conditioned stimulus and results in a conditioned response \(the same as the unconditioned response\)

- **Higher-order conditioning** or **second-order** conditioning is associating another stimulus to the conditioned stimulus

![A model showing a cat learning to associate the sound of an electric can openner with food, it then learns to associate a squeaky cabinate with the electric can opener](HigherOrderConditioning.jfif)

- The period of learning is called **acquisition**
- **Extintion** is the process when an organism starts to forget
  - Often is caused when the unconditioned stimulus is no longer given after the conditioned stimulus
- **Spontaneous recovery** is the recovery of the association after an extintion and a period of rest

- **Stimulus discrimination** is responding to a specific conditioned stimulus only
- **Stimulus generalization** is responding to all stimulus that are similar to the conditioned stimulus

>### **Behaviorism**
>
>Founded by John B. Watson, behaviorism is a school of thought that started in the early 20th centery
>
>It is based around classical conditioning and believed that behavior was determined by a simple stimilus-response reaction without any unconscious processes (As apposed to Sigmund Freud
>
>To prove his theory, John B. Watson preformed an experiment called the [Little Albert Experiement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMnhyGozLyE) where he made a stable baby named Little Albert fear all furry animals and objects

# Operational Conditioning
- Process of associating a behavior with consequents
  - Stimulus (reinforcement or punishment) is given after an action rather than before
- Found by B. F. Skinner
- Based on Edward Thorndike's **law of effect** 
  - Behaviors followed by a positive consequence are more likely to happen, but those followed by a negitive consequence are less likely to happen

# Observational Learning
