# Classical Conditioning
- Process of anticipating events
- Discoved by Ivan Pavlov
  - Studying the digestive system of dogs, specificly their drool
  1. Dogs were given food *(unconditioned stimulus)* and drooled *(unconditioned response)*
  2. Bell was rung *(neutral stimulus)* before the arrive of food
  3. Dogs started to drool *(conditioned response)* at the bell *(now conditioned stimulus)* before the food came out
- An unconditioned stimulus will always result in an unconditioned response
- A neutral stimulus never gives a response
- The learner associates the neutral stimulus with the unconditioned stimulus
- The neutral stimulus becomes the conditioned stimulus and results in a conditioned response (the same as the unconditioned response)
